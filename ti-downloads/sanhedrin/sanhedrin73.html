                              The following may be prevented from sinning at the cost of their lives, that is, they may be killed in order to prevent them from committing the transgression: one who pursues a fellow to kill him, and one who runs after a male to sodomize him, or after a betrothed maiden to violate her.
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              
However, the following may not be killed: one who pursues a beast for the purpose of sodomy, one who is about to desecrate the Sabbath, or one who is about to engage in idol worship.
