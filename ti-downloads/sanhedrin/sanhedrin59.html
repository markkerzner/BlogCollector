                              ...” This is true for any day, even Monday.

Rabbi Yochanan said that an idolater who engrosses himself in Torah study is liable to death, as it says "
                              <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=33">
                                Moses commanded us the Torah; it is an inheritance
                              </a>

                              ." - any man, even an idolater? - This refers to the seven Noahide laws.
                              <br/>

But can fish do work? - Yes, since it is prohibited to use a combination of fish and goat for pulling a wagon. Why was he then specifically prohibited a limb torn from a living animal? - Adam was allowed to eat an animal that died of itself.
