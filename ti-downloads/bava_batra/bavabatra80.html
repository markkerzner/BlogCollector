                              If one buys the production of a dovecote from his fellow,  he must allow the first pair of doves that is produced to fly with the mother – that is, to remain with her; they are not included in the sale.
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              
It is the tendency of doves to lay a pair of eggs almost every month of the year. These eggs hatch and produce one male and one female, which themselves begin to mate at the age of two months.
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              
In order to stay in the dovecote, the mother must have, in addition to her mate, her daughter as a companion. The daughter, too, must have her offspring as companions, since her mother is not company enough. The buyer must, therefore, leave all these pairs and not take them for himself.
