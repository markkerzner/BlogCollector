If the fact that one sold an ox or sheep was established by the testimony of two witnesses, and the fact that he then slaughtered or sold the stolen animal was established by the testimony of one witness or by his own admission, he pays the twofold payment for stealing, but not the fourfold or fivefold payment, for lack of proof.

If he stole a sheep and then slaughtered it on the Sabbath, he pays the twofold payment for stealing, but not the fourfold payment for slaughtering, because slaughtering on the Sabbath is a capital offense anyway, and "one is subject only to the greater penalty."
