                            There are four cases of monetary loss for which the perpetrator is not liable to pay under the law of man but he is liable under the law of Heaven (because one is not liable for causing damage indirectly):

                                One who breaches a wall before his fellow's animal (the animal exited its enclosure and fled);

                              <li>
                                One who bends his fellow's standing grain toward a fire (the fire then reached the grain with the aid of an unusually strong wind);

                              <li>

                                One who knows testimony beneficial to his fellow but does not testify on his behalf.
