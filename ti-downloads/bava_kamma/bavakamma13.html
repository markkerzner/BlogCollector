                            The laws of damages only apply to privately held properties. Thus, if the identity of the damaging ox is unclear, and the owners of the two suspect oxen each blame the other, one saying, "It was your ox that damaged," while the other one saying, "No, it was your ox that damaged" - the damaged party cannot collect from  either owner.

One is liable for damage done in any place except for a premises that is reserved exclusively for the damage. For if the damage occurs on his premises, the damager can say to him, "What was your ox doing on my premises?"
