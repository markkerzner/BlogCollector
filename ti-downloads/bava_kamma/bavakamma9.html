                            When the verse states "...he [the owner of the pit] shall return money..." , it means to include an article worth money as an acceptable form of payment, and even something such as bran. There are three ways to understand this:
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
1. One can pay with bran only if he has no money and no land;
                            <br/>
                            
2. One can pay with bran only if he doesn't have money;
                            <br/>
                            
3. One can pay with bran even if he has money, and if he has no money or movables left, then he needs to pay with superior land.
