                            If one's pitcher of water broke in the public domain and another person slipped in the water, Rabbi Yehudah makes the owner of the pitcher liable only when he at least had the intent to put the pitcher down. Rabbi Meir makes him liable even when he stumbled or if the pitcher broke by itself; if a camel stumbled, he is liable if he stumbled first, and the camel tripped over him.

They also argue after the breakage: one maintains that if a person leaves his hazardous objects and declares them ownerless, he is liable, while the other one maintains that the person is not liable.
