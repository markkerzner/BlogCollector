When Miriam contracted leprosy, it was not Moses, who was not a kohen, who pronounced her status, and not Aaron, who was a relative, but it was God himself, who also was a kohen, Who confined her and later released her.

However, Rabbi Shimon says that this anger too left a mark, and Aaron became a kohen instead of Moses, who thus remained a Levi.
