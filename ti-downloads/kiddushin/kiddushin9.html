                            If a man gives $100 to a woman and says to her, "Become betrothed to me with this," - and before his eyes she throws it into the sea or into fire, she is not betrothed. Might one think that, since she is obligated to repay, she agrees to marry but is testing him for anger management? - No!

A certain man was drinking wine in a shop and a woman came and said to him, "Give me a drink." He said, "If I do, will you marry me?" She said, "Give it me!" - This means nothing and she is not betrothed.
