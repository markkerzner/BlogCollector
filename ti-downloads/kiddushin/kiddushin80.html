                            A man may not be secluded even with two women (and certainly not with one), because a woman may hope that her female companion can be convinced to duplicate her act - following the teaching that the minds of women are easily swayed.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
One may be secluded with two women if his wife is present, and he may even sleep in the same room as them in an inn.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
A woman may be secluded with two men if they are of high moral character, but if they aren't, then even with  a group of ten it is not permitted.
