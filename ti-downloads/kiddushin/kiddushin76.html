                            A Kohen who wishes to marry a daughter of a Kohen must examine the status of her ancestors: her mother and the mother of her mother, the mother of her mother's father and  
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">
                              her
                            </span>
                             mother, the mother of her father and 
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">
                              her
                            </span>
                             mother, the mother of her father's father and 
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">
                              her
                            </span>
                             mother - but only if there is some evidence of a blemish.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
If in that line he finds a Kohen who served at the Altar, or a member of the Sanhedrin, or a public official, or a charity collector, the investigation stops. The latter two are often involved in quarrels, so any blemish in their genealogy is already known.
