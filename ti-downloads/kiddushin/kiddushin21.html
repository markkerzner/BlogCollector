A Hebrew servant who has sold himself into servitude and wants to redeem himself early enjoys a special privilege: his redemption price is the lower of his purchase price and the current value of his service for the remaining years. 
                            </div>
                            <div>
                              <br/>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                              
Through the sequence of Torah passages, we can deduce which transgressions caused him to become poor and sell himself. Still, now that he wants to become free again, he gets a leniency. 
                            </div>
                            <div>
                              <br/>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                              
He can reduce his remaining years of servitude with a partial payment, but this can result either in a gain or a loss for him, if his price fluctuates.
