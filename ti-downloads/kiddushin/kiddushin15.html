                            There are four categories of Hebrew servants discussed in the Torah:
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
1. A man who steals and can not repay, who is sold by the courts in order to pay the one he robbed;
                            <br/>
                            
2. A girl under the age of twelve who is sold by her father;
                            <br/>
                            
3. A man who sells himself because of his poverty;
                            <br/>
                            
4. A Jew who sells himself to a gentile.
                            <br/>
                            
A servant sold by the court can be given a Canaanite slave-woman in order to have children.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Even today there is a way for a mamzer (illegitimate) to have kosher children from a Canaantie slave-woman.
