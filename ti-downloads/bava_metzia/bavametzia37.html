                              If a thief told two people, "I stole one maneh ($5,000) from one of you, but I don't know from which of you I stole it," - or if a custodian told two people, "The father of one of you deposited a maneh with me, but I don't know which one he was" - he gives each one a maneh, because he acknowledged the claim himself.

                            <div>
                              Both cases describe going beyond the letter of the law. The thief wants to avoid Heavenly retribution, and the custodian feels at fault for not keeping the records.
