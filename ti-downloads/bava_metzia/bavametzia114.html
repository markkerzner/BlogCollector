                              Rabba Bar Avuha found Elijah the prophet standing in a cemetery of idolaters and asked him, "Why is master who is a Kohen standing in a cemetery?"

                              Elijah answered, "Did you not learn the Order  of Purities?"  For Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai said, based on "

                              He said to Elijah, "I am not able to properly study the four most important orders, am I to study the sixth (Purities)? - for I am very poor."

                              Elijah brought him up to the Garden of Eden and told him to collect some leaves. Rabbah understood that he was spending his reward in the World To Come and threw the leaves away. Still, his cloak absorbed the smell, and he sold it for 12,000 golden dinars - and distributed them to his sons-in-law.
