                                A man borrowed a cow for half a day and rented it for half a day, and the cow died. The lender claims, “It died while being borrowed,” making the borrower liable, but the borrower says “I don't know” - the borrower is liable.

                                Can we disprove from here the following ruling of Rav Nachman? If one claims to another, “you owe me a maneh (100 zuz)” and the other one says, “I don't know if I owe you” - the defendant is NOT liable. But in the first ruling he is!
