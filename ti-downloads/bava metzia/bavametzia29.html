                            One who finds a lost object is not required to bear the expense of maintaining it until the owner reclaims it. For example, a rooster or calf need to be fed but can not do anything to earn their keep. They should be sold, and the money held for the owner. If an animal works and eats, such as an ox or donkey, it should be put to work for twelve months, then sold. One may use that money, so if it is lost, he is responsible.

                            If one found books (scrolls), he should read from them once in thirty days, to air them out and prevent their decay.
