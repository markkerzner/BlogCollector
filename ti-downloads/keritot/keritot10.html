                            Some mistakes mentioned in the Torah require a sacrifice whose value depends on the financial status of the one who brings it. For example, if a litigant in money matters asked a witness to testify, and the witness refused, the litigant then asked him to swear that he knows nothing, and he swore (falsely), the witness needs to bring a sacrifice. This variable cost sacrifice is an animal in the case of sufficient means, a bird offering if he is poor, and a flour offering, if he is indigent. 

                            <br/>

The same type of sacrifice is brought by one who inadvertently entered the Temple while being spritually impure, or one who ate the meat of sacrifices in this state.

A woman who gave birth brings a male lamb if she has the means, and a pair of birds if she is poor. A spiritual leper (metzora) brings three animals (sin, guilt, and burned offerings) if he has the means, and one animal and two birds if he is poor.
