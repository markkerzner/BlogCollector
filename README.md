Blog to web site conversion.
============================
This project is to collect blog entries from Blogger and to make web pages out of it, so that you can put them on your web site. 
Currently it works with specific blog, http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/, which it prepares for a specific web site, http://talmudilluminated.com/.
However, with a minor modification you can collect data from other blogs and make web pages for your web site.

Recently added: read the blog content, previously saved to the hard drive, and create web pages for the site.
